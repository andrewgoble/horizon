## Session 1 — 2026-04-30

**Work done:**
- Cloned andrewgoble/horizon → ~/Projects/jambys-theme/
- Created preview branch, pushed to origin (bobbyteenager89 added as collaborator on andrewgoble/horizon)
- Added CLAUDE.md with live-site guardrails, branch model, MCP gates
- Added PROGRESS.md, .gitignore (.superpowers/ ignored), pre-push hook (blocks preview→main)
- Drift check: Apr 15-17 commits = Shoplift A/B framework + editor saves (not upstream Horizon). Already in preview.
- Size selector regression found: commit 57de4dd — see docs/audits/2026-04-30-size-selector-bug.md
- Lighthouse baseline: see docs/audits/2026-04-30-lighthouse-summary.md

**Lighthouse scores (jambys.com, 2026-04-30):**

| Accessibility | 84 | 81 |
| Best Practices | 50 | 50 |
| SEO | 100 | 100 |

**Top fixes by priority:**
1. Size selector mobile regression (snippets/variant-main-picker.liquid ~line 533)
2. Typekit render-blocking — enable font-display:swap in Adobe Fonts dashboard
3. Third-party JS bloat — GTM duplicates, Alia, Loop Returns loading eagerly
4. Console errors / MissingRefError in anchored-popover-component
5. No hero image preload (LCP: 6.0s mobile)

## Session 2 — 2026-04-30

### Accomplished
- Discovered `develop` branch already existed and was connected to Shopify shadow theme (Graft Studio Nov 26 2025 work)
- Migrated all work from `preview` to `develop` via cherry-pick (8 commits)
- Rewrote CLAUDE.md: GitHub-only workflow (no Shopify CLI push/pull needed), correct branch names
- Deleted `preview` branch (local + origin)
- Fixed mobile size selector: removed Graft Studio's `font-size: 11px !important` + `min-width/height: auto` overrides from `snippets/variant-main-picker.liquid` (bug was live on jambys.com since Nov 26 2025)
- Merged `main` into `develop` — pulled in 80 commits of live content (announcement bar, etc.) so shadow theme matches live site

### Files Modified
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Rewrote: GitHub-only workflow, removed CLI push/pull, removed theme ID placeholder |
| `snippets/variant-main-picker.liquid` | Removed Graft Studio mobile overrides shrinking size selector |
| `snippets/shoplift.liquid` | Conflict resolved (timestamp only) — took main's version |

### Next Steps
- [ ] Verify size selector fix on shadow theme (mobile)
- [ ] Typekit font-display:swap (Adobe Fonts dashboard — no code)
- [ ] Third-party JS audit — GTM duplicates, Alia, Loop Returns
